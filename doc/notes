current design is not really model-view-intent
intents are really "state mutators", i.e. loaded guns 
each component is preloaded with exactly how its interaction should change state

refactor: components should know nothing about how their intents should modify state
change intents to actual data (case classes or objects for parameterless intents)
should result in the vdom doing less work (i.e. intents wont change but mutator functions might)
